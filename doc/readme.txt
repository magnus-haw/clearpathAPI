REQUIRED SETUP
----------------
A CHM viewer is required in order to open and view the sFoundation-Ref.chm
file. 

The recommended CHM viewer is kchmviewer. Kchmviewer is a free, open-source 
viewer. More information regarding the viewer itself can be found at
http://www.kchmviewer.net. 

To install kchmviewer on Ubuntu run the command:
sudo apt-get install kchmviewer

A file can be launched from the command line using the command:
kchmviewer filename

Any other CHM viewers may be used but are not generally recommended. Other
options include:

- xchm
To install xchm on Ubuntu run the command:
sudo apt-get install xchm

- Okular
To install Okular it is recommended to use your software distribution center.
In Ubuntu this would be the 'Ubuntu Software Center'. An add-on is required to
support viewing CHM documents in Okular which can be installed directly from
Okular's install page.
